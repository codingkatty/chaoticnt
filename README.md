## about
**chaoticn't** is a game about navigating accross double pendulums to get to the star and proceed to the next level. it can be challenging as you need to be skilled to time the pendulums in order to get to the goal. the double pendulums can also be very chaotic and hard to predict- even tho the inital values are set for the levels, it makes it hard and you'd need to play multiple times to master the level.

## how to play
use W/A/D or arrow keys to move. alternatively, you can also use spacebar to jump. when you jump on a pendulum, you automatically hold on to it, and you can jump again to 'unhold' it. the levels are very straightforward, you just need to move to the right accross multiple pendulums to reach the star, and to the next level. there is a total of 4 levels (tutorial+3) and after completing all the levels, you win the game :>

(*since i have some skill issue,*) i am not sure how to calculate a double pendulum, sooo i watched [this youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzPe_S-RVE) and the equations are from [here](https://www.myphysicslab.com/pendulum/double-pendulum-en.html)
